# Pose-Analysis PASCAL3D-STS
Nearest-neighbour pose analysis in the downsampled binary, radial and learned embedding spaces established for the shape silhouettes of the dataset.

- COCO-Core-code: is used to save .mat files with pose-category-image data
- pascal3D-poseparams: saves pose-data and image-names in separate files
- pascal-torchbin-test/train: saves image data in bin file for conversion to t7 format 
- anchorpt-neighbor-stats: nearest neighbour analysis for pose and category similarity in shape embedding spaces
